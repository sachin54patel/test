<h2>How does CodeIgniter work</h2>
<p>Codeigniter Works on MVC patern (Model- View- Controller)</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The <b>Model</b> represents your data structures. Your model classes will contain functions that help you retrieve, select,insert, update and delete information in your database.
	</li>
	<li>The <b>View</b> is information that is being presented to a user. A View will normally be a web page, but in CodeIgniter, a view can also be a page fragment like a header or footer or any other type of “page”.</li>
	<li>The <b>Controller</b> serves as an intermediary between the Model, the View, and any other resources needed to process the HTTP request and generate a web page.</li>
</ul>
